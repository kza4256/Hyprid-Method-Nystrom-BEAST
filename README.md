# Hyprid-Method-Nystrom-BEAST
This MATLAB project demonstrates signal reconstruction using two types of landmarks: change-point (CP) and randomly selected points. The algorithm alternates between these landmark types to explore their individual and combined effects on reconstruction accuracy and execution time.
The main steps include:

    Loading neural signal data and predefined change points.
    Alternating between CP and random landmark selection.
    Reconstructing the signal using Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) with the Nystr√∂m method.
    Visualizing results for CP-only, random-only, and combined reconstructions.
    Analyzing execution time versus relative reconstruction error.

Key Features:

    Dynamic landmark selection combining CP detection and random sampling.
    Comprehensive visual analysis through side-by-side comparison plots.
    Error vs. execution time analysis with a color-coded scatter plot.
